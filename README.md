## Acknowledgments

This tool wouldn't be possible without [@mojodna](http://github.com/mojodna) laying the groundwork with [transcoding OSM to ORC](https://github.com/mojodna/osm-pds-pipelines) and making it [queryable with Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/querying-openstreetmap-with-amazon-athena/).
