üåç `mrworldwide` is a command line tool that queries the [AWS OSM public datasets](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/osm/).

## Installation
```
npm install -g mrworldwide
```

## Usage

Currently to use the `query` command you should manually setup an Athena database and osm tables. The cli requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `ATHENA_PREFIX`: A namespace for the database and database tables.
- `AWS_REGION`: Region where the S3 bucket and Athena queries will run
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key
- `AWS_OUTPUT_BUCKET`: Bucket where query results are stored

### API 
The cli is aliased to `worldwide`

```
Usage
  $ worldwide query <sql>
  $ echo <sql> | worldwide query

Examples
  $ worldwide query "SELECT count(*) from osm.changesets"
```

## Built With
Under the hood, `mrworldwide` uses Amazon Athena and [`little-owl`](https://github.com/developmentseed/little-owl) to run queries.

## Acknowledgments

This tool wouldn't be possible without [@mojodna](http://github.com/mojodna) laying the groundwork with [transcoding OSM to ORC](https://github.com/mojodna/osm-pds-pipelines) and making it [queryable with Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/querying-openstreetmap-with-amazon-athena/).
